			<h2>Professional experiences</h2>
			<p>In 2020, I had an internship as a growth marketing intern at Anghami Lebanon. Anghami is a streaming music platform from the middle east.  I worked closely with the digital marketing, the content creation and the growth team. I was introduced to influence marketing and was really amazed by the number of local musicians I've met! </p>
